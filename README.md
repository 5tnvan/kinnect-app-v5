## ‚öôÔ∏è Set-up

>The app is built using [Scaffold-Eth-2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) (NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript), [Subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol), [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) and [Supabase Auth](https://github.com/supabase/supabase).

To set up:
1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/5tnvan/tipping-app-v5
cd tipping-app-v5
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

4. You must create an env.local file and put your Supabase keys into this for the app to run. Or ask tran@micalabs.org for help.
